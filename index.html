                <h1> Moving To The States</h1>
                <p> It is well known that the USA, by far, has the largerst number of Immigrants. Have you
                     yourself ever thought about relocating to the states? This report will take you through a 
                    journey of discovering the best field of employment and location of state based on your own
                    preferences.

                <h1>Get A Job</h1>
               
                <p> The question that most people have before commiting to migrating
                    to a different country is "Will l find a job?".
                   The plot shown aside visualises the top 60 jobs which had the most
                    advertised job vacancies in 2022.
                    <br> <br> 
                    It can be seen that <span class='medical_text'> Nurses </span> had the most advertised job 
                    vacancies by a large gap, closely followed by <span class='driver_text'> Delivery Drivers </span> and
                    <span class='sales_text'> Sales Support Assistant </span>.
                    <br> <br>
                    In contrast the jobs with the highest (average) advertised salaries
                    are both <span class='engineer_text'> engineering </span>  related with Nursing jobs coming in the second.
                    <br> <br>
                    The question then becomes whats more
                    important getting a job without too much hustle or
                    getting paid a lot more than the average american earner?

                <h1>Choose Your State</h1>

                <p>  A desirable location in this context may be the one that has a low unemployment 
                    rate which makies it be easier for one to find a job. 
                    Others however may prefer making a decision based on the
                    geographical location.
                    <br> <br> 
                    Florida, Carlifornia and Texas have an unemployment rate of 0.01,
                    making them favourable for the average job hunter.
                    <br> <br>
                    The State Alaska, on the flip side, has the highest rate of Unemployment,
                    followed by the state of Wyoming.

                <h1>Hot Or Cold</h1>

                <p> Some people prefer Hot weather whilst others prefer cold. The Map
                    Aside shows the average seasonal temperature of each state. 
                    <br> <br> 
                    If One prefers Hot weather, coast line states like Florida, Louisiana,
                     and Texas will be the best options.
                    If One however prefers Cold weather, upper north states like
                    North Dekota, Minnesota and Wisconsin would be suitable.
                    <br> <br>
                    The Landlocked states like Kansas typically have moderate temperatures compared to the outer
                    states through out the seasons.

                <h1>Cost Of Living</h1>

                <p>  In most cases, it all comes down to the cost of living. How much
                     does it actually cost to live in a state. The USA is counted to be
                     one of the most expensive places to reside in on a global scale.
                    <br> <br> 
                    States like Hawaii, Carlifornia, New York, Massachusetts, Alaska, Vermont
                     New Hampshire and The District Of Colombia are observed to be expensive in all 
                    five expense categories
                    <br> <br>
                    On the other side, states like Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi
                    are observed to be fair valued in all five expense categories.
                    
                    <br> <br>
                     As one would expect, the cost housing is observed to be have the highest expense rate.
                     The visual goes on to show that health and grocery expenses have the second highest expense
                     rate, which is expected for the later but not so much for the former
                     <br> <br>
                    
                <h1> Ready To Move ?</h1>
                    <P>
                    From the above report, one is able to make an informed decision before making
                    "the move", From the field of speciality to the state that has the most favourable
                    conditions. Missouri has my vote, what's yours ?
